If I'm making a small change, with my work's current process I have to:
1) make a JIRA ticket for it
2) reference that ticket in my commit message
3) open a PR with that same reference

These are too many steps! I just want to say "turn this commit into a ticket and PR". This repo does that. You probably don't need it!
